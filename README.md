# Greetings
Hello, my name is Mason. I am a young, enthusiastic programmer that has worked on a multitude of solo, self-made projects from all sorts of mediums. 
<br>

# What I do
Throughout the past few years, I've worked on songs, arts, mods, applications and have dabbled in game development. One of my first programming languages I learned was Swift, a high-level programming language used primarily for Apple products. Since then, I've picked up a few more languages, such as Python and C#, to use for development on Windows machines and other programs, such as Unity.

In the end, I hope that, with all I've learned and done over the years, that my skills can be used to assist or create massive projects.

# Socials
While I don't use social websites all that much (lots of arguing, not enough thought), I do have a YouTube channel avaliable if you wish to check it out
